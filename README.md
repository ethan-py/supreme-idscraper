### Requirements
```
Python 3.6
Requests (pip install requests)
JSON (pip install json)
```

### How is this useful?
```
You can use ids to create product URLs. 
Since this grabs every new product, it's useful for monitors and you won't have to add links manually
eg. http://www.supremenewyork.com/shop/171354
```

### How to run?
```
python scrape.py
```
